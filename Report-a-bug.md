Before reporting please follow the troubleshooting guide first, it contains steps that will help you solve most of the problems that might not be related or directly related to the extension.

**Any issue that fails to follow these instructions will be automatically closed and marked as invalid.**


## Troubleshooting

- Make sure that you are using the new YouTube Material layout. If you aren't then enable it and try again: https://www.youtube.com/new

  - This extension is built just for the new layout, it will not work with the classic layout.

- Make sure that you are using the most recent Iridium version. If you aren't then update it, restart the browser and see if the problem has already been fixed.

  - Quite often problems have already been fixed in a recent version that your browser hasn't had the time to updated Iridium yet. To check which version is the latest visit the latest release tracker located here: https://github.com/ParticleCore/Iridium/releases/latest or the respective branch (alpha/beta) if you are using a development version.

- This extension is only being supported for **stable versions** of Firefox 57+, there are no plans to support any other browser in the future, including any browser forks. If you are using a different browser then try running the extension in one of the supported versions.

  - If the problem still persists move to the next step.

- Make sure you are not using the Flash player. Right click on your player and see if it lists "About Adobe Flash Player <Number>..."
  - The extension works with the Flash player, but many features do not simply because they are not compatible or possible to work with the limitations imposed by this player type. The only solutions are to use the HTML5 player by visiting this link and activating it: https://www.youtube.com/html5 or to use the Flash player without using the incompatible features

- Disable the extension and restart the browser.
  - If the problem still persists then it is not related to the extension. It might be caused by another extension, browser setting or by the website itself
  - If the problem doesn't persist move to the next step

- Disable all other extensions except Iridium you might have running in your browser and restart the browser.
  - If the problem doesn't persist then it might not be related to the extension, it is most likely being caused by a conflicting extension. Enable each one individually until the issue returns, then proceed to the posting section
  - If the problem still persists move to the next step

- Check if your browser or extension has a new update version, if it does then update them.
  - If the problem still persists move to the next step

- Reset the extension settings to their default.
  - If the problem still persists move to the next step

- Create a new browser profile and install only Iridium, see if the problem still persists. New profile instructions:  [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles#w_starting-the-profile-manager)
  - If the problem doesn't persist then it was a browser setting that was causing the issue
