The following lists represents the currently supported shortcuts for the YouTube player.  
 - `Local shortcuts` can only be used when the player is selected. These shortcuts can be used globally only if the user enables the [Player shortcuts always active](https://github.com/ParticleCore/Particle/Iridium/Features#player_always_active) feature  
 - `Global shortcuts` can be used from anywhere in the YouTube page except when the user has an input area selected (reply area, search area, etc.)  
 - `NA` not available
