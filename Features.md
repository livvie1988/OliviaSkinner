### <a name="player_quality"/>Default video quality

Sets which quality the video player should play. If the quality does not exist it will select the one closest to it.  

_Notice: Due to a bug in the YouTube video player that is yet to be fixed by the YouTube team, the quality option might appear empty when the selected quality does not exist, however the closest quality is being selected correctly._

### <a name="player_hfr"/>Allow HFR (60fps) streams

_Notice: There might be cases when disabling HFR streams might not be possible due to YouTube not offering the equivalent quality streams. If such is the case the HFR streams will not be disabled for that video_
